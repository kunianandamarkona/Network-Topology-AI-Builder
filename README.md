# Network-Topology-AI-Builder
AI-assisted tool for designing, generating, and managing network topologies using containerlab. Built with a Streamlit web interface and integrated with Cisco’s AI language models, Clab Architect empowers network engineers to describe their desired network in plain English and instantly obtain ready-to-deploy containerlab YAML files.

Key Features

Natural Language Topology Design:
Describe your topology (e.g., “R1--R2--R3, mesh, ring, star, or custom layouts”) and let the AI generate compliant containerlab YAML automatically.

One-Click Deployment & Teardown:
Deploy, destroy, or deep-clean your network lab directly from the browser interface.

Web-Based SSH Console Access:
Launch secure, shareable SSHX web terminals to access any router node from your browser.

Automated Management:
Deep Clean feature guarantees complete removal of labs, containers, and Docker networks.

Real-Time Visualization:
Instantly visualize your topology graph and access detailed router information.

Integration with Cisco LLMs:
Supports advanced YAML generation tailored for Cisco xrd and other supported platforms.


N.B containerlab and docker loaded with image should be installed first .
